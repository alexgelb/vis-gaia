Vielleicht gibt es hier nur eine sinnvolle Correlation bei gewisser Entfernung (unwahrscheinlich weiß ich aber ja..) oder eben immer...



astrometric_delta_q - Parralax
astrometric_delta_q: In the TGAS solution astrometric_delta_q (Δ⁢Q) indicates the difference between the Hipparcos proper motion and the TGAS proper motion. A large value of Δ⁢Q could indicate non-linear motion (e.g. in a binary).

astrometric_excess_noise - astrometric_excess_noise_sig
astrometric_excess_noise: This is the excess noise ϵiϵi of the source. It measures the disagreement, expressed as an angle, between the observations of a source and the best-fitting standard astrometric model (using five astrometric parameters). The assumed observational noise in each observation is quadratically increased by ϵiϵi in order to statistically match the residuals in the astrometric solution. A value of 0 signifies that the source is astrometrically well-behaved, i.e. that the residuals of the fit statistically agree with the assumed observational noise. A positive value signifies that the residuals are statistically larger than expected.

astrometric_excess_noise_sig: Significance of excess noise (double)
A dimensionless measure (D) of the significance of the calculated astrometric_excess_noise (ϵiϵi). A value D>2 indicates that the given ϵiϵi is probably significant.

Potential TODO:
~Piechart: Compare Red/Blue Stars with AL and AC weight



5 VIS Techniques:
ZOOM
Because of the big amount of data, the zoom technique is very important for the stars around the sun and clusters around the sun 3D scatterplot. With the billions of stars in a dataset the plot has so many dots (stars) in it, that the user wouldn't be able to extract relevant information of the plot. The user should be able to zoom in and out of the Scatterplot and turn the plot around to get another sights of the distribution and information of stars and clusters.

TOOLTIP
Combined with the zoom function, the tooltip technique shows special information of a dot (e.g. name of the star, weight, distance to sun,...) if a star/cluster is clicked. This can be very useful if a dot attracts the attention of the user because of a strange behaviour (e.g. bunch of stars in a close area).

BRUSHING & LINKING
The brushing and linking will be very helpful for the user to set limits to the min and max value of a scatterplot. For the 2D scatterplots there we have the same problem as with the 3D scatterplot. Because of the amount of data the user will be overwhelmed of the information and won't be able to extract useful information of the plot. With the brushing and linking technique the user can decide on his own what minimum and maximum is interesting to see for him and so can also just have a look on small parts of the data.

FILTER
For all of the plots we will need filters to filter useless data which will have no values, null values or other values we could not process.

DIMENSION STACKING
The dimension stacking is used for the mean astronomic weight of the source in AL and AC direction compared to each cluster. The user has a fast overview of both weight variables for each cluster, which is triggers an interaction with other plots if clicked. This can help to determine eyecatching information of special clusters very fast.
